# CI/CD Pipeline Demo Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines into a full-stack application. The app consists of both **Frontend** (built with React.js) and **Backend** (built with Node.js/Express). The purpose of this project is to showcase a streamlined CI/CD workflow that automates testing, building, and deploying the application, ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery.

This demo project is ideal for demonstrating an end-to-end solution for building, testing, and deploying web applications. It includes:

- **CI (Continuous Integration)**: Automates the process of testing and building the application when changes are made.
- **CD (Continuous Deployment)**: Automatically deploys the application to a production or staging environment after a successful build.

## Features

- **Frontend**: A React.js application that fetches data from the backend and displays it to users.
- **Backend**: A simple Express server that handles API requests and communicates with a mock database.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrated with GitHub Actions for automating the build and deploy process.
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for failed API requests or data fetching.
- **Testing**: Integration of testing frameworks for both frontend and backend to ensure stability before deployment.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Axios (for API calls), CSS (for styling)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **CI/CD Tools**: GitHub Actions
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **API**: RESTful API built with Express
